/**
 * Given a binary tree, find the number of pairs where sum of 2 nodes’ values equal to k
* Eg:
<br>
* 1 <br>
* 2 3 <br>
* 4 5 7 <br>
* Say k=7, output =2 ( 2+5, 3+4) <br>
* Suggested an approach where I’d use inorder traversal of this,
* Then interviewer asked me to solve the simplified problem, find k in sorted array instead of tree.
* Got solution for this one, to have 2 pointers at each end, and traverse accordingly.
* I was asked the approach for extending same to BST.
* Then, I implemented the same for BST using stack.
